This project implements the remote position control of a Phantom Omni robotic manipulator using modern control techniques. The system is modeled as a master-slave teleoperation setup, with nonlinear dynamics simplified through linearization. Two controllersâ€”PID and Backsteppingâ€”are designed and simulated in Simulink to ensure force and position tracking. State feedback control, pre-compensators (static and dynamic), and full-order observers are developed and validated. Stability is proven via Lyapunov methods, and optimal gain matrices are derived using MATLABâ€™s symbolic and numerical solvers. The results demonstrate reliable tracking and robustness against disturbances and aging, offering a strong foundation for real-time haptic interaction.
